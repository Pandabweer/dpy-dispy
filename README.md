This repositor is for a private Discord bot regarding a group of friends.
Any code of mine can be used for your own projects.

Please do note that i'm working with .env files. Inside the config you can see what you need to fill in.
This is made to work with Python 3.10+ or later, if any major version comes out this will be updated accordingly.
